## Introduction
My name is Quintus Thibodeaux. Thank you for visiting my webpage. I am a nerd who enjoys computers, sports, statistics, and music. I have been employed in various industries, but the challenge and problem solving of programming really appealed to me. I decided to dive right in, and pursue a career change. I enrolled in DigitalCrafts, an immersive coding bootcamp focusing on the most modern web technologies.
