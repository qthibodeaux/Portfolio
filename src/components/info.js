        p1: "The blog is really late. Work, life, and projects are really taking up alot of my time. Finding that balance is tricky right now. I am very specific with how I do my work. And finding the right component library for me has been more of a challenge than I initially thought. It is truly a Goldilocks situation.",
        p2: "All of the component libraries that I have been using are all very powerful and have varying degrees of ease-of-use. I find some I like more than others. Some more aesthetically pleasing than others. I have yet to find that right one yet. Some have the components I want but require more work to align. Others may be a breeze to use but are missing key components or features that I am trying to use. It is part of the growing pains of learning but incredibly frustrating when I have a project that I could wrap up if this one piece would just come together.",
        p3: "Besides the frontend component libraries, I have been using backend tools much more. I am REALLY comfortable with Express. I can get it set up and doing what I want it to do pretty efficiently now. Getting pretty craft with sql, joins, and selects and many of the tools. I am not doing anything incredibly complex right now, but creating a large database and getting REST requests to function as desired makes me happy. Especially given my current front end frustrations. Lol I like the sound of that.",
        p4: "I have added studying to my list of duties. Brushing up on technical interview questions. My first one, I thought I was prepared forðŸ™ƒ. But the game is different from practice. I gotta get better. So I have been brushing up on React, Express, and â€˜basicâ€™ knowledge. So knowing why the code works the way it does or the different inputs for Regular Expression or correct React hook usage will definitely make me a much better programmer in the long run. Well thatâ€™s all for now. Hope I can get this Text App up soon. Fingers crossed on this new library.",

I donâ€™t have an issue juggling the projects and I have done well with time management. I just have to remember that programming takes much longer than I think it is going to take. Even when I have it planned out, have my resources readily available, and reduce scope of the project, it will rarely come together as fast as I hope it is.",
        p2: "On that note, when I am comfortable and in my zone, I can crank out some code! I am getting pretty efficient in my comfort areas. I am happy with my progress in working with Bootstrap, React, Express, and knex. It is really encouraging and more than a sign that I can do it. But I know I can be great at this coding thing.",
        p3: "On the opposite side of that, I have to remember to push myself. Donâ€™t just settle for doing the things I am good at. But to practice those new skills and become comfortable with those. It took some tooling to get comfortable with Bootstrap. I know my blindspots and will continue to improve. I am really grateful for the circle I have. My mentors continue to push me but remain great resources of knowledge when I am in a rut. ",
        p4: "Wrapping this up, I am excited for the projects I have coming up. The few solo projects are coming to a close. One is a major project that wouldâ€™ve taken me WEEKS to finish earlier this year. I cranked out most of the code last weekend before the weekâ€™s task beat me up and delayed my progress. Soon I will also start collaborating with some of my bootcamp friends. Those guys are awesome and itâ€™s fun to communicate and watch us grow together. ",
